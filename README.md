# SQL-Study
This is a collection of SQL codes that I wrote as part of my self-study. I used different sources of problems from the internet, such as LeetCode, and tried to find various solutions and approaches to get the desired results. I also experimented with different RDMS, such as MySQL Workbench and Microsoft SQL Server, and learned about their similarities and differences. I will indicate which RDMS I used for each code in this repository. I also plan to explore other RDMS and learn how to use them in the future.
