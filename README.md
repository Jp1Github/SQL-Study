# SQL-Study
These are codes I wrote studying SQL. 
Trying to solve questions and finding alternative or several approaches to get the needed results.
Using MySQL WorkBench and Microsoft Server RDMS gaining insight how those two are similar and its differences.
However, I will also try other RDMS and learn it too. Any code I put in here will note which RDMS used.
Sources of questions are from the in internet, Leetcode and others.
