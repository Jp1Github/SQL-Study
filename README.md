# SQL-Study
This repository is a compilation of SQL code that I’ve crafted during my self-learning journey. I’ve tackled a variety of problems sourced from online platforms such as LeetCode, and in the process, I’ve discovered multiple solutions and strategies to achieve the desired outcomes. My exploration has spanned across different Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) including MySQL Workbench and Microsoft SQL Server, providing me with insights into their unique features and commonalities. For each piece of code in this repository, I’ve specified the RDBMS used. As part of my ongoing learning endeavor, I intend to delve into other RDBMS and master their utilization in the future.
